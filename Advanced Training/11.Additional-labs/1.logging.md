### Configuring RBAC for Elasticsearch logs and events


1. Let's start by creating a service account that has full permission to the Calico Enteprise Manager UI. Note that "tigera-network-admin" is a superuser access for Kibana and all Calico Enterprise resources in projectcalico.org and networking.k8s.io API groups.

```
kubectl create sa admin -n default
kubectl create clusterrolebinding admin-access-tigera-manager --clusterrole tigera-network-admin --serviceaccount default:admin
kubectl get secret $(kubectl get serviceaccount admin -o jsonpath='{range .secrets[*]}{.name}{"\n"}{end}' | grep token) -o go-template='{{.data.token | base64decode}}' && echo
```

2. Log into the Enteprise Enterprise Manager UI using the token provided in the previous step. Get yourself familiar with the UI. Browse to "Flow Visualizations", "Timeline", "Service Graph", "Alerts" and ensure you can view information on these sections. Once done, log out Manager UI.

3. This time, let's create a service account that has very limited permission in the Manager UI. We will add more roles to the service account in stages. 

```
kubectl create sa bob -n default

kubectl create -f -<<EOF
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: ui-required
rules:
# UI users need access to authorizationreviews and authenticationreviews.
- apiGroups: ["projectcalico.org"]
  resources: ["authorizationreviews", "authenticationreviews"]
  verbs: ["create"]
EOF

kubectl create clusterrolebinding ui-required-access --clusterrole ui-required --serviceaccount default:bob

kubectl get secret $(kubectl get serviceaccount bob -o jsonpath='{range .secrets[*]}{.name}{"\n"}{end}' | grep token) -o go-template='{{.data.token | base64decode}}' && echo

```
4. Log into the Enteprise Enterprise Manager UI using the token provided in the previous step. Check and see what navigation menus are available to you. Check and see if you can see any information on "Flow Visualziations" or "Timeline" menus. You should not be able to see any information on these two menus. Log out once done.

5. Let's create a new role that has permission to view the flow logs and bind it to service account "bob" created in the previous step.
##### Note: The user needs permission to list at least one endpoint to view flows. If the user needs to view policies within the flows, the user then needs the relevant permissions listed in the "networking.k8s.io" and "projectcalico.org" apiGroups.

```
kubectl create -f -<<EOF
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: tigera-manager-flows-only
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["services/proxy"]
    resourceNames: ["https:tigera-api:8080", "calico-node-prometheus:9090"]
    verbs: ["get","create"]
  - apiGroups: ["lma.tigera.io"]
    resources: ["cluster"]
    resourceNames: ["flows"]
    verbs: ["get"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["list"]
  - apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io"]
    resources: ["networkpolicies"]
    verbs: ["list"]
  - apiGroups: ["projectcalico.org"]
    resources: ["hostendpoints", "networksets", "globalnetworksets", "networkpolicies", "globalnetworkpolicies"]
    verbs: ["list"]
EOF

kubectl create clusterrolebinding tigera-manager-flows-only-access --clusterrole tigera-manager-flows-only --serviceaccount default:bob
kubectl get secret $(kubectl get serviceaccount bob -o jsonpath='{range .secrets[*]}{.name}{"\n"}{end}' | grep token) -o go-template='{{.data.token | base64decode}}' && echo
```

6. Log into the Enteprise Enterprise Manager UI using the bob token. Check and see if you can see any information on "Flow Visualziations". What about "Timeline" and alerts? Log out once done.


7. Let's now update the previous role "tigera-manager-flows-only" to enable bob to access all elasticsearch logs.
  - for "resourceNames" in the "apiGroups: ["lma.tigera.io"]", replace ["flows"] with ["flows", "audit*", "events", "dns", "l7"]


```
kubectl edit clusterrole tigera-manager-flows-only
```
```
### Note: The role should like the following.
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: tigera-manager-flows-only
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["services/proxy"]
    resourceNames: ["https:tigera-api:8080", "calico-node-prometheus:9090"]
    verbs: ["get","create"]
  - apiGroups: ["lma.tigera.io"]
    resources: ["cluster"]
    resourceNames: ["flows", "audit*", "events", "dns", "l7"]
    verbs: ["get"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["list"]
  - apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io"]
    resources: ["networkpolicies"]
    verbs: ["list"]
  - apiGroups: ["projectcalico.org"]
    resources: ["hostendpoints", "networksets", "globalnetworksets", "networkpolicies", "globalnetworkpolicies"]
    verbs: ["list"]
```

8. Log into the Enteprise Manager UI using the bob token. Check your permissions again.


### Viewing Flow Logs

1. Configure the flowLogsFlushInterval and dnsLogsFlushInterval in felixconfiguration so that felix flushes the flow and dns logs more frequently and they are available in elasticsearch. We are doing this configuration only in the lab to save time. 
```
# set default flush interval for the flow logs (default: 300s)
kubectl patch felixconfiguration.p default -p '{"spec":{"flowLogsFlushInterval":"10s"}}'
# set flush interval for DNS logs
kubectl patch felixconfiguration.p default -p '{"spec":{"dnsLogsFlushInterval":"10s"}}'
```

2. Run the following command to get the customer pod in the yaobank namespace.

```
kubectl get pods -n yaobank -l app=customer
```
```
tigera@bastion:~$ kubectl get pods -n yaobank -l app=customer
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
customer-787758576-dpxcl   1/1     Running   0          58s

```
3. Then run the following command and copy the IP address of the summary pod in the yaobank namespace.

```
kubectl get pods -n yaobank -l app=summary -o wide | head -n 2
```
```
tigera@bastion:~$ kubectl get pods -n yaobank -l app=summary -o wide | head -n 2
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP              NODE           NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
summary-748b977d44-gwfjp   1/1     Running   0          2m35s   10.48.162.148   ip-10-0-1-31   <none>           <none>
```
4. Run the following command to exec into the customer pod. 

```
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -n yaobank -l app=customer -o name) -n yaobank -- sh
```

5. Use the IP address of the summary pod that we captured in the previous step and run the following curl command 5 times.

```
curl 10.48.162.148
```
```
tigera@bastion:~$ kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -n yaobank -l app=customer -o name) -n yaobank -- sh
# curl 10.48.162.148
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>404 Not Found</title>
<h1>Not Found</h1>
<p>The requested URL was not found on the server.  If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>
# curl 10.48.162.148
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>404 Not Found</title>
<h1>Not Found</h1>
<p>The requested URL was not found on the server.  If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>
# curl 10.48.162.148
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>404 Not Found</title>
<h1>Not Found</h1>
<p>The requested URL was not found on the server.  If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>
# curl 10.48.162.148
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>404 Not Found</title>
<h1>Not Found</h1>
<p>The requested URL was not found on the server.  If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>

<title>404 Not Found</title>
<h1>Not Found</h1>
<p>The requested URL was not found on the server.  If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>
# exit
```
6. Run the following command and note the name of the node that the customer pod is running on. In this case the pod is running on ip-10-0-1-31.

```
kubectl get pods -n yaobank -l app=customer -o wide
```

```
tigera@bastion:~$ kubectl get pods -n yaobank -l app=customer -o wide
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP              NODE           NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
customer-787758576-dpxcl   1/1     Running   0          4m    10.48.162.149   ip-10-0-1-31   <none>           <none>
```
#### Note: In this lab ip-10-0-1-30=worker1 and ip-10-0-1-31=worker2 for ssh purposes.

7. ssh into the worker node and cd to the following directory. Make sure to ssh into the right node.


ssh worker(1/2)

```
cd /var/log/calico/flowlogs/
```
8. Then open the flows.log and look for customer pods. 

```
less flows.log
```
```
/customer
```
9. You should see an output similar to the following. Get yourself familiar with the output below. Some of the important fields are: "source_name_aggr", "source_namespace", "source_labels", "dest_name_aggr", "dest_namespace", "dest_labels", "dest_port", "num_flows", "num_flows_started","num_flows_completed",
Why "source_ip", "source_port", and some of the other fields are set to null or "-"?
#### Note: "num_flows":5,"num_flows_started":5,"num_flows_completed":5, which matches the number of curl command that we executed.

```
{"start_time":1620709416,"end_time":1620709729,"source_ip":null,"source_name":"-","source_name_aggr":"customer-747d66f8bf-*","source_namespace":"yaobank","source_port":null,"source_type":"wep","source_labels":{"labels":["pod-template-hash=747d66f8bf","version=v1","app=customer"]},"dest_ip":null,"dest_name":"-","dest_name_aggr":"summary-85c56b76d7-*","dest_namespace":"yaobank","dest_service_namespace":"-","dest_service_name":"-","dest_service_port":"-","dest_port":80,"dest_type":"wep","dest_labels":{"labels":["pod-template-hash=85c56b76d7","version=v1","app=summary"]},"proto":"tcp","action":"allow","reporter":"src","policies":{"all_policies":["0|__PROFILE__|__PROFILE__.kns.yaobank|allow"]},"bytes_in":3245,"bytes_out":1725,"num_flows":5,"num_flows_started":5,"num_flows_completed":5,"packets_in":25,"packets_out":25,"http_requests_allowed_in":0,"http_requests_denied_in":0,"process_name":"-","num_process_names":0,"process_id":"-","num_process_ids":0,"original_source_ips":null,"num_original_source_ips":0,"tcp_mean_send_congestion_window":0,"tcp_min_send_congestion_window":0,"tcp_mean_smooth_rtt":0,"tcp_max_smooth_rtt":0,"tcp_mean_min_rtt":0,"tcp_max_min_rtt":0,"tcp_mean_mss":0,"tcp_min_mss":0,"tcp_total_retransmissions":0,"tcp_lost_packets":0,"tcp_unrecovered_to":0}
```

10. Log into Calico Enterprise Manager UI using your token and browse to the "Flow Visualization" from the left navigation bar.


![flow-visualization](https://github.com/tigera-cs/tigera-lab/blob/master/trainingworkbooks/Advanced%20Training/img/logging/Flow-Visualization.JPG)


11. On the top right corner of the page, from the "All Namespaces" drop-down menu select "yaobank", from "All Names" drop-down menu select "customer" pod prefix, and from the "All Flows" drop-down menu select the "customer" pod prefix connection to "summary" pod prefix. Get yourself familiar with the flow visualizationa output. 

![flowlogoutput](https://github.com/tigera-cs/tigera-lab/blob/master/trainingworkbooks/Advanced%20Training/img/logging/Flow-Log-Output.JPG)


#### Viewing DNS Logs

1. Exec into the customer pod.

```
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -n yaobank -l app=customer -o name) -n yaobank -- sh
```

2.Do the following name resolution and exit out the pod.

```
nslookup microsoft.com
```
```
# nslookup microsoft.com
Server:         10.16.0.10
Address:        10.16.0.10#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   microsoft.com
Address: 40.76.4.15
Name:   microsoft.com
Address: 104.215.148.63
Name:   microsoft.com
Address: 40.113.200.201
Name:   microsoft.com
Address: 40.112.72.205
Name:   microsoft.com
Address: 13.77.161.179

```

3. Log into Calico Enterprise Manager UI using your token and browse to the "Kibana" from the left navigation bar. A new browser page should open. Log into Kibana console using the provided elasticsearch credentials.

username: 
```
elastic
```
password: following token
```
kubectl -n tigera-elasticsearch get secret tigera-secure-es-elastic-user -o go-template='{{.data.elastic | base64decode}}' && echo
```

4. From the left hamburger menu, select "Dicover".

5. In the Discover page, "select tigera_secure_ee_dns*" index.


![tigera-secure-dns](https://github.com/tigera-cs/tigera-lab/blob/master/trainingworkbooks/Advanced%20Training/img/logging/tigera-secure-dns.JPG)


6. Let's run the following query from KQL.

```
qname : microsoft.com
```

7. Click on the arrow next to the time to exapnd the the DNS log and get yourself familiar with DNS log format and informatiom.

### Viewing Audit Logs

1. Implement the following network policy just for the sake of checking audit log feature.

```
kubectl apply -f -<<EOF
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-ingress-tcp
  namespace: yaobank
spec:
  selector: app == 'summary'
  ingress:
  - action: Allow
    protocol: TCP
    source:
      selector: app == 'customer'
    destination:
      ports:
        - 80
EOF
```


2. Log into Calico Enterprise Manager UI using your token and browse to the "Policies" from the left navigation bar. Ensure to use an account that has permission to view policies.

```
kubectl get secret $(kubectl get serviceaccount tigercub -o jsonpath='{range .secrets[*]}{.name}{"\n"}{end}' | grep token) -o go-template='{{.data.token | base64decode}}' && echo

```

![calico-enterprise-policies](https://github.com/tigera-cs/tigera-lab/blob/master/trainingworkbooks/Advanced%20Training/img/logging/Calico-Enterprise-Policies.JPG)


3. Click on the pencil icon for "allow-ingress-tcp" policy in the default tier. Scroll to the bottom of the page and look at the "Change Log" info.

4. From the "Ingress Policy Rules (1)" section close to the bottom of the page, go to the far right side of rule and click on the X to remove the rule.


![ingress-rule-audit](https://github.com/tigera-cs/tigera-lab/blob/master/trainingworkbooks/Advanced%20Training/img/logging/Ingreess-Rule-Audit.JPG)


5. Then scroll to the top right corner of edit policy page and click Enforce.

6. Click again on the Policies from the left navigation bar. Then click the pencil icon for "allow-ingress-tcp" policy. Browse to the bottom of the page and look at the "Change Log" again. Click on the policy change log to open. Note who made changes to this policy at what time and what changes.
#### Note: You should see the same audit log on the Timeline pane.

![policy-audit-log](https://github.com/tigera-cs/tigera-lab/blob/master/trainingworkbooks/Advanced%20Training/img/logging/Policy-Audit-Log.JPG)

7. Clean up the policy created.

```
kubectl delete -f -<<EOF
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-ingress-tcp
  namespace: yaobank
spec:
  selector: app == 'summary'
  ingress:
  - action: Allow
    protocol: TCP
    source:
      selector: app == 'customer'
    destination:
      ports:
        - 80
EOF
```
